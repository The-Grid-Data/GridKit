Goal: go through these research tasks, make a new doc per item in docs/research and check these as you go along.
Research:

- [x] making an npm package: need best practices for delivering a small size package
- [x] thegrid tgs: the schema of the graphql queries is found at tgs.thegrid.id (this will be upgraded later, but you can get full json here)
- [x] thegrid mcp: use the connected mcp to query locally during research
- [x] graffle docs: get best practices for handling graffle for type generation and custom (simple/easy to use) hook
- [x] tanstack docs: use best practices from tanstack for caching data and invalidation.

After research:

- [x] make a SKILLS.md file & CLAUDE.md file that can be used to build this.
